## Overview {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The following report examines Data Access in Real Time (DART) fish passage data observed at Willamette Falls. From 2001-2010, counts of several fish species were recorded moving through the fish ladder. The following code wrangles and visualizes this time-series data to reveal trends in the runs of three salmon species: coho, jack coho, and steelhead.

### Original time series

```{r}
# time series of daily fish passage data
ggplot(data = fish_longer, aes(x = date, 
                               y = count,
                               color = species)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.9) +
  theme_minimal(12) +
  theme(legend.position = c(.6, .75),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(
          size = 12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(
          vjust = 8)
        ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue3", "goldenrod3", "darkgreen")) +
  labs(x = element_blank(), y = "Fish counts per day") 


```

**Fig. 1:** Time series plot of Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead counts by month between 2001 and 2010 at the Willamette Falls fish ladder.

#### Takeaways

-   Steelhead have historically been the most consistent and abundant species throughout the first several years of observation.
-   Coho surged in 2009 and 2010, and they were most counted fish species the last two years of observations.
-   There is significant seasonality in the fish passage data for all three species. Jack coho and coho tend to pass through the fish ladder at the same time of year while steelhead move through a different time.

### Seasonplots

```{r}
# season plot for each fish species
fish_longer %>% 
  gg_season(y = count, 
            pal = c("dodgerblue3", "goldenrod3", "darkgreen")) +
  theme_minimal(12) +
  labs(x = element_blank(), y = "Daily Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    size = 12))
```

**Fig. 2:** Seasonplot showing how the salmon runs vary for the three species over the course of a year from 2001-2010 at the Wilamette Falls fish ladder.

#### Takeaways

-   Jack coho and coho tend to pass through the fish ladder at the same time of year while steelhead move through a different time.

-   Jack coho and coho runs are shorter in duration, only lasting a couple of months and peaking in October. Outside of the typical run season, these species are very rarely observed.

-   Steelhead runs are typically around 6 months and occur in the first half of the year. Additionally, steelhead are often observed outside of their typical run season.

### Annual counts by species

```{r}
# wrangling fish passage data by year
fish_annual <- fish_longer %>% 
  index_by(year = ~year(.)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(yearly_counts = sum(count))

# visualizing annual fish counts
ggplot(data = fish_annual, aes(x = year, 
                               y = yearly_counts, 
                               color = species)) +  
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.9) +
  theme_minimal(12) +
  theme(legend.position = c(.6, .75),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(
          size = 12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(
          vjust = 8)
        ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue3", "goldenrod3", "darkgreen")) +
  labs(x = element_blank(), y = "Total fish count per year") +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) # custom axis breaks
  
```

**Fig. 3**: Annual counts of each of the three species observed at the Willamette Falls fish ladder 2001-2010.

#### Takeaways

-   Steelhead abundance has fluctuated significantly year to year across the 10 years of observation.

-   After being very consistent from 2001-2008, Coho runs increased dramatically in 2009.

-   Of the three in this analysis, Jack coho are the least observed species at the Wilamette Fish ladder. This stayed relatively consistent over the course of observations.
